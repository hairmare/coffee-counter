Coffee Counter
**************

We want to replace our existing coffee machine tally sheet with some beautifully over-engineered DIY hard and software.

What we already have:

- PoC RFID Reader code
- RFID Reader
- 10 Transponders (more are 1.20 CHF each at zerko.ch)
- Serial Display (users gots to know)
- Distance Sensor (for RFID Reader activation purposes)
- Arduino
- Protoboard

What we need:

- SD Card interface (networkless setup & storage)
- project box (meethinks transparent)
- audio output module (.... yeah! maybe this: http://dshop.ch/osc/product_info.php?products_id=109624)

Things to take in account:

- networkless -> sdcard sneakernetting
- how do we power the setup (accu vs. wall wart or even poe)
- autoprovisioning w/o name in display until next sneakersync
- keep redundant data ie. log to sdcard + counter for display
- physical undo button for erroneous tag reads
